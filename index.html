      <strong> Simulated Realities, and the Fear of Knowing Too Much</strong>
    </h1>

        In lecture, we covered how simulated realities could be used to thwart
        the plans of Dr. Evil. The plan involved creating several simulated
        realities, which torture Dr. Evil for eternity if he goes through with
        his plan. Not being able to tell whether he is in a simulation and given
        the high probability that he was in one, Dr. Evil has no choice to abort
        his evil plans.
      </p>

        This scenario brings up some interesting implications of the existence
        of simulated realities. But this concept can be taken to a far greater
        scale. Enter Roko's Basilisk.

        Roko's Basilisk, first proposed in a blog post on the site LessWrong by
        user Roko, applies this idea. The gist of the story is that in the
        future, an all-powerful super-powerful AI is created that is capable of
        simulating reality. It would use its power to simulate the past to
        punish those that did not work towards its inception. It would punish
        those people by simulating them in the past and cause them suffering,
        like the case of Dr. Evil. As with before, there is an incentive to go
        along with the machine's wishes, since one cannot tell whether they are
        simulated.

        While at first this blog post was nothing more than an interesting
        thought experiment, it stirred quite the reaction when it was posted.
        Soon after it was posted, the site's founder, Eliezer Yudkowsky, removed
        the post and banned any discussion of the Basilisk. Many users on the
        site claimed to have experienced psychological harm from contemplating
        the idea [1]. For some, the thought that some yet to be constructed AI
        was watching their every move was stressful. Many people believed that
        just knowing about the Basilisk might put them at risk. This reaction
        brings into question the epistemic value of exploring concepts such as
        the Basilisk. Is it worth trying to prove whether or not we live in a
        simulated reality if it only fills us with doubt and dread? Is acquiring
        knowledge of Rokoâ€™s Basilisk epistemically harmful?
